Incorrect or Damaged Products: If you receive incorrect items or products that are damaged upon delivery, please contact us immediately with photos of the issue. We will assess the situation and arrange for a replacement or issue a refund accordingly.

Non-Delivery: If your order does not arrive within the specified delivery timeframe and it is determined to be due to a fault on our end, we will issue a refund for the undelivered items.

Return and Exchange Policy:
We do not accept returns or exchanges for reasons such as change of mind or sizing issues. Please ensure that you review the product descriptions, sizes, and colors before placing your order.
